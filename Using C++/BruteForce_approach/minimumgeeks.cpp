// Given an array A[] of N integers. In each operation, Geek can increase the 
// ith element by 1 (i.e set A[i] = A[i] + 1 where 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤N). The task is to 
// calculate the minimum number of operations required such that there is no prefix in the array A[] 
// whose sum is less than zero. (i.e For all i, This condition should be satisfied A[1]+A[2]+...A[i]>0 ).
// 2 -3 1 pai 1
// diff between sum of +ve numbers and sum of -ve numbers ?
